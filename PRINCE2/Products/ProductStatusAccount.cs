     * Purpose:
     * If required by the projectâ€™s change control approach, a product status account is used to provide information about the state of products within defined limits.
     * The limits can vary.
     * For example, the report could cover the entire project, a particular management stage, a particular area of the project or the history of a specific product.
     * It is particularly useful if the project manager wishes to confirm the version number of products.
     * The product status account may be derived from:
     * - Configuration item records.
     * - A stage plan.
     * PRINCE2 does not define the composition, format and presentation or quality criteria for this product.
