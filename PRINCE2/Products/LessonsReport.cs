     * Purpose:
     * A lessons report may be produced to support the lessons log if more information is required.
     * It can be used to pass on any lessons that can be usefully applied to other projects.
     * The purpose of the report is to provoke action so that the positive lessons become embedded in the organizationâ€™s way of working, and so that the organization is able to avoid any negative lessons on future projects.
     * A lessons report can be created at any time in a project and should not necessarily be delayed until the end.
     * Typically it can be included as part of the end stage report and end project report.
     * It may be appropriate (and necessary) for there to be several lessons reports specific to the particular organization (e.g. user, supplier, corporate or programme).
     * The data in the report should be used by the corporate group that is responsible for the quality management system, in order to refine, change and improve the standards.
     * Statistics on how much effort was needed for products can help improve future estimating.
     * A lessons report may be derived from:
     *  - The PID (for the baseline position)
     *  - The lessons log (for identification of lessons)
     *  - The quality register, issue register and risk register (for statistical analysis)
     *  - Quality records (for statistical analysis)
     *  - The communication management approach (for the distribution list).
     * PRINCE2 does not define the composition, format and presentation or quality criteria for this product.
