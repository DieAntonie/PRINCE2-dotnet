     * Purpose:
     * Configuration item records are created only if required by the projectâ€™s change control approach.
     * Their purpose is to provide a record of such information as the history, status, version and variant of each configuration item, and any details of important relationships between them.
     * The set of configuration item records for a project is often referred to as a configuration library.
     * The records may be derived from:
     * - The change control approach.
     * - The product breakdown structure.
     * - A stage plan and work package.
     * - The quality register, issue register and risk register.
     * PRINCE2 does not define the composition, format and presentation or quality criteria for this product.
